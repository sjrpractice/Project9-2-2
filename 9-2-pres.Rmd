## Guinea pig tooth growth

This project uses plotly to visualize data on guiniea pig tooth growth based on the dosage (in milligrams per day) and the supplement type: ascorbic acid (VJ) or orange juice (OJ).

## Tooth growth by supply and dosage

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
library(datasets)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
data("ToothGrowth")
plot_ly(ToothGrowth, x= ~dose, y= ~len, type = "scatter", mode="markers", color= ~supp)
```
